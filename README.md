# Natural Clean

Natural Clean is a site that helps people to book eco-friendly cleaning services for their property in the greater Dublin area. A goal for the site is to convey the eco-friendly and clean nature of the company. To do this, images such as fruit, plants, and natural products will feature throughout the site. These images will be simplistic and minimal in nature.

The site will be targeted towards commercial and residential clients, such as home owners, landlords, and business owners that are environmentally conscious or have sensitivities or allergies to chemicals.

Natural Clean allows people to quickly and easily arrange to have their property cleaned in an environmentally friendly way.

You can view the live site here - <a href="https://elvira-94.github.io/natural-clean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natural Clean</a>

## Site Structure

The Natural Clean website is a one-page website with 6 navigation links for the visitor to use. The Home Page is the default loading page, and the sections following it are the About, Services, Products, FAQ's and Contact. The pages are all accessible primarily through the navigation menu, but the user can also press on the burger menu located on the right side of the screen if they are using a device with a small screen size. Clicking on the burger menu will allow them to view a dropdown menu of the site and visit these sections in the order listed above. This will help the user have the option of not scrolling down the website to visit these sections on different devices.

## Design Choices

### Colour Scheme

The final colour scheme chosen is one based on a darker green, lighter green, and off-white. This colour palette gives off a fresh, clean and eco-friendly atmosphere to the website, which Natural Clean hopes to pass on to the user.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/adobe-color-scheme.png" width="30%" height="30%" alt="Colour Scheme"></p>

### Typography

For this website, one main font was used throughout. To give a clean modern feel, ['Questrial'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Questrial?query=questrial#standard-styles) designed by Joe Prince & Laura Meseguer was used for both the body text and the headings. This font defaults back to to 'Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif.' The Questrial typeface have an easy-to-read feel to them, and the full circle curves on many characters adds a refreshingly seamless look to the design while still keeping it in line with the clean style of the site by utilising letter spacing and line heights.

## Features

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

The fully responsive navigation bar includes links to all sections of the site. On the left side of the navigation bar, the company logo is presented, which itself links to the homepage of the site.

On the right side of the navigation bar, links to all sections of the site are presented to the client. If the client's screen size is using a screen size less than 950 pixels in width, then a burger menu is presented to the client, allowing them to view a dropdown menu once selected which will provide links to the site's sections.

The goal of the responsive burger menu is to provide a clutter free presentation of the site to the client. On a smaller screen size, having many navigation links could be distracting and reduce the clean aesthetic of the site.

The burger menu is implemented using only HTML and CSS. It is done so by representing the burger menu icon as a HTML form checkbox, with an image of the burger menu. Once clicked, the dropdown menu of navigation links is shown.

- __The Landing Page Image__

The landing page includes a photograph of a green leaf, with text overlay providing the client with a brief introduction to what Natural Clean is. Within this text overlay, there is also a call to action button provided, allowing the user to navigate to the contact form, allowing them to quickly book our service.

The intention of the green leaf hero image is to show to the client Natural Clean's focus on being environmentally friendly, while aslso staying simple enough to keep a clean site aesthetic.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/landing-page.png" width="80%" height="80%" alt="Landing page image"></p></details><br />

- __About Us Section__

The About Us Section will show the user the advantages of booking our green cleaning services as well as the advantages of Natural Clean's offering of 24/7 call-outs no matter the time or day to deliver a range of cleaning services.

The user will recognise the value of booking cleaning services that are exclusively non-toxic and eco-friendly in Dublin. This should persuade the user to consider using our Natural Clean site as their eco-consious, one-stop shop for any of their hypoallergenic cleaning needs.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/about-us.png" width="80%" height="80%" alt="About us image"></p></details><br />

- __Services Section__

The Services Section will provide the user with a range of services offered by Natural Clean. The services will be displayed in a grid format around a picture of the Natural Clean logo. 

The value of this section is to allow the user to know what they can request from Natural Clean and what the request consists of. 

<details><summary><b>Services Section Image</b></summary>

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/services.png" width="80%" height="80%" alt="Services section image"></p></details><br />

- __Products Section__

The Products Section will detail the cleaning materials used and include useful supporting images to what the products will look like such as the 'Universal Stone Mulit-Purpose Cleaner' image and the 'Lemon Essential Oil' image.

This section will be valuable to the user to see firsthand what natural cleaning agents will be used to put clients minds at ease that only products that are safe for the planet and safe for their health will be used.

<details><summary><b>Products Section Image</b></summary>

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/products.png" width="80%" height="80%" alt="Products section image"></p></details><br />

- __FAQ Section__

The FAQ section will answer some of the more common questions that Natural Clean receive from their customers. The questions will be displayed as a list of accordion styled items, and once clicked, the answer to the question that was clicked, will show on the screen under the question. If clicked again, the answer will revert back to being hidden. 

The value of this section is to provide Natural Clean's users with answers to questions they may have before they need to ask.

<details><summary><b>FAQ Section Image</b></summary>

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/faq.png" width="80%" height="80%" alt="FAQ section image"></p></details><br />

- __Contact Section__

The Contact Section icluding the contact form and iframe map of the company's address was created with simplicity in mind. The contact form includes a 'Get in Touch With Us heading and 3 input fields. These input fields are: Name, Email and Send Us A Message. 

The Contact Section is fully responsive and places the map image below the contact form when the device width is insufficient. The form will be centralised on the page at this point. This helps the user easily get a quote or send a message of any questions they have with ease of mind.

<details><summary><b>Contact Section Desktop Image</b></summary>

<details><summary><b>Contact Section Responsive Image</b></summary>

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/contact-responsive.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="Contact Section Responsive image"></p></details><br />

- __The Footer__

The Footer contains quick links, social media links and and the company logo with opening hours text below it. To improve the user experience, the quick links will quickly redirect the user back to the relevant pages sections. In addition the social media links open in a seperate tab. 

The social links to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube are there for educational purposes of this project and will take the user to the home page of each respected site. If this site were to be published outside of this project, they would be altered to re-direct the user to the appropriate Natural Clean social media pages.

Finally the company logo itself also takes the user back to the home page and they can easily see what hours the business operates for which was an no-brainer when thinking of the users experience being a positive one.

# Testing

* ## Code Validation

    * The Natural Clean website has undergone extensive testing both manually and via testing tools. All the code has been validated via the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and the [JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/). 3 minor errors were found on the index.html when tested on [HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) but were fixed immediately and documented below.<br /><br />

* ### HTML Validation Image With Errors

* ### JS Validation Image

    ![JS Validation](docs/images/js-validation.png)

* ## Lighthouse Testing

    ![Lighthouse Report](docs/images/lighthouse-report.png)
    
    * When this report was first generated, the performance of the site was 94, the accessibility was 81, and the SEO was 75. 
    * These were fixed with the following updates:
        * Performance
            Images needed to be compressed in order to speed up page load times. This was done using [Compressor](https://compressor.io). The results of this were as follows:

            <details><summary><b>Pre Compression</b></summary>
            <p align="center"><img src="docs/images/site-images-pre-compression.png" width="80%" height="80%" alt="Site images pre compression"></p></details><br />

            
            <details><summary><b>Post Compression</b></summary>
            <p align="center"><img src="docs/images/site-images-post-compression.png" width="80%" height="80%" alt="Site images post compression"></p></details><br />

            This resulted in an increased of site performance to 95. 

        * Accessibility

            This initial report of 81 showed that the site was missing alt tags from some images, that some form elements were missing associated labels, and that iframe elements were missing a title attribute. 

            Once these issues were fixed, the accessibility score for the site increased to 100.

        * SEO

            The initial report of 75 indicated that the site was missing meta tags, and that not all images on the site had alt attributes. By the time this aspect of the site was addressed, alt attributes had been added to all images while improving the sites accessibility. Once meta tags were added to the site, the SEO score of the site increased to 100.
   

* ## Site Contrast Testing

    <details><summary><b>WCAG Report</b></summary>
    <p align="center"><img src="docs/images/WCAG-report.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="WCAG Report"></p></details><br />

    * This report from [WCAG](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wcag-color-contrast-check/plnahcmalebffmaghcpcmpaciebdhgdf?hl=en) shows a single error with regards to contrast for a span element on the site. The reason for this error is due to the burger icon that displays on devices with a small screen size. This burger menu was implemented using a Youtube video reference using only CSS, as Javascript has not been covered on the course yet. This code is causing contrast issues, due to the way in which the span element for the 'nav-check' checkox input is constructed.   

    <details><summary><b>a11y Report</b></summary>
    <p align="center"><img src="docs/images/a11y-report.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="a11y Report"></p></details><br />

    * The report from [a11y](https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/) shows a similar result to WCAG. Without this burger menu implementation, there would not be any contrast errors on the site. This is something I would like to improve upon once my knowledge of Javascript improves. 

* ## Responsiveness Testing

    * Responsiveness of the site was tested manually, using both [Google Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) and [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/). The site has also been tested on multiple mobile devices physically also by friends and family. 

* ## Manual Testing

    * Throughout development, manual tests were extensively carried out: 

        * Are we viewing a fresh version of the site
            * Task: Refresh the page ensuring cache is refreshed
            * Expected Result: A non-cached version of the page has loaded for testing

        * Are all navigation links working as expected?
            * Task: Click on each navigation link on the site
            * Expected Result: You are brought to the correct location on the page. In supported browsers, smooth scrolling takes place. 

        * Are all images loading correctly?
            * Task: Look at each image on the site
            * Expected Result: The image is displaying on screen, instead of a box indicating a bad reference/url
        
        * Are all images located in the correct location?
            * Task: Look at each image on the site
            * Expected Result: Each image is located exactly as expected and is not breaching any parent divs or containers

        * Is all text content positioned correctly? 
            * Task: Look at each element of text on the screen
            * Expected Result: Each text element is locacted and centered exactly as expected, and is not breaching any parent divs or containers. 

        * Is all text content worded correctly?
            * Task: Read all text on the site
            * Expected Result: The text on the site is worded as expected 

        * Is each section of the site responding as expected for different screen sizes?
            * Task: Open Google Chrome Dev Tools and set the device screen size from small to large sizes, and back to small
            * Expected Result: The elements of the site respond as expected to changes in device screen width

        * Is the contact form requiring the correct information when the submit button is pressed?
            * Task: Click the submit button without entering required info
            * Expected Result: The form will indicate that mandatory information is missing

            * Task: Click the submit button after entering required info
            * Expected Result: The form will proceed as expected

        * Is the contact form validating email addresses as expected?
            * Task: Click the submit button after entering an invalid email address (missing '@gmail.com')
            * Expected Result: The form will indicate the error in the email field

            * Task: Click the submit button after entering an invalid email address (missing '.com')
            * Expected Result: The form will indicate the error in the email field


# Unfixed Bugs

* CSS Implementation of Burger Menu resulting in contrast errors from contrast testing tooling

    * As mentioned in the testing section, when undergoing contrast testing for the site, an error shows from a span element which is used to style the burger menu for the site.
      This is because the burger menu is implemented as a checkbox input element, styled to like a burger menu. 

      If I had more knowledge on Javascript, I would liked to have done a Javascript implementation of a burger menu.
