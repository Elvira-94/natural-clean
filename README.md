# Natural Clean

- What the project hopes to accomplish?

Natural Clean is a site that helps people to book eco-friendly cleaning services for their property in the greater Dublin area. A goal for the site is to convey the eco-friendly and clean nature of the company. To do this, images such as fruit, plants, and natural products will feature throughout the site. These images will be simplistic and minimal in nature.

- Who is the intended audience?

The site will be targeted towards commercial and residential clients, such as home owners, landlords, and business owners that are environmentally conscious or have sensitivities or allergies to chemicals.

- How is the project useful to this audience?

Natural Clean allows people to quickly and easily arrange to have their property cleaned in an environmentally friendly way.
